### HELLO!
Currently, I just want to learn more on developing programs. I am not fully set on a specific part of computer science, but am exploring what I can do. At University of Illinois Chicago, there's a lot of classes on CS I can take, and as long as I don't have to write an essay, it's all good to me.

- I have done a lot of "HELLO WORLD" in various languages, but I think the best language I can use is C++.
  - Other languages I learned include C, Java, and R.
  - I'm okay with debugging (gdb).
  - Can use git.
- I can use an Arduino and Raspberry P, but am not seeking to pursue electrical engineering.
- I do have some experience with Blender and CAD programs, so I can create 3D Models for art or for 3D printing.

Previous projects that I have done include working with a group to create an 8-bit game, and an arcade machine. Surprisingly, I am not pursuing to become a game developer.
I hope that I can find a lot more things to discover in UIC until my graduation at Fall 2025, or anything I find out by myself. :)
