### Hello!
I am currently interested in learning various topics in computer science while developing my knowledge of 3D modeling. At the University of Illinois Chicago, there are many CS classes I can take, and as long as I don't have to write an essay, it's all good for me.

- My best language would be Python.
  - However, other languages I learned include C++, C, Java, Python, and R.
  - For frontend development, I can use React.js, which uses CSS, Javascript, and HTML.
  - I can debug C and C++ with gdb.
  - I can also use Docker and git and am knowledgeable about AWS.
- I can use an Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but I am more interested in software development rather than electrical.
- I do have some experience with Blender and CAD programs, so I can create 3D models for art or 3D printing.

Previous projects that I have done include working with a group to create an 8-bit game and an arcade machine. Surprisingly, I am not pursuing to become a game developer.
I hope that I can find a lot more things to discover at UIC until my graduation in Fall 2025 or anything I find out by myself. :)
