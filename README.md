### Hello!
I am currently interested in learning various topics in computer science while developing my knowledge of 3D modeling. At the University of Illinois Chicago, there are a lot of classes on CS I can take, and as long as I don't have to write an essay, it's all good to me.

- I have done a lot of "HELLO WORLD" in various languages, but I think the best language I can use is C++.
  - Other languages I learned include C, Java, Python, and R.
  - I'm okay with debugging (gdb).
  - Can use git.
  - Can read React and HTML and can write CSS. Javascript is readable.
- I can use an Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but I am more interested in software development rather than electrical.
- I do have some experience with Blender and CAD programs, so I can create 3D models for art or 3D printing.

Previous projects that I have done include working with a group to create an 8-bit game and an arcade machine. Surprisingly, I am not pursuing to become a game developer.
I hope that I can find a lot more things to discover at UIC until my graduation in Fall 2025 or anything I find out by myself. :)
